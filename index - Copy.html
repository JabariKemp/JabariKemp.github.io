					If someone several decades ago could take a snapshot of the world then, and compare it to a snapshot of today, there would be one major difference. The ubiquity of computers. Seemingly everyone has a mobile device and personal computer. It has become society’s standard and expectation. Even mechanical machines, like cars, for example, are becoming enveloped with advance computational features such as autonomy. Looking around, it is prevalent that there is not a shortage of technology, but there is one in the education system that should be teaching students about the field of study that contributes to it all. I say that computer science should be implemented more in the education system because it is a necessary skill for most modern jobs and is not available to a large population of people.

				<h3 class="paraTitle">The New Movement</h3>
				<p class="paraText">
					Many journals and videos have been published to attest to the urgent need for students to pursue computer science. The most popular one must be from Code.org, which is an organization built solely to promote computer science. Code.org made a viral video with statements from a bunch of famous programmers to motivate students. Collegiate level organizations like the Association of Computational Machinery contributes toward the same effort. They publish articles monthly like the Preparing Students for Computing Workforce Needs in the United States journal and hold many conferences for those interested in the field to attend for further insight about the workforce (Kaczmarczyk and Dopplick 21). The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the job openings and gaps between the number of people going into the workforce with computational related degrees and the openings still left unfilled (Lockhard and Wolf 90). There is not a shortage of information to prove why students should consider computer science.

				<h3 class="paraTitle">Every Field and Industry Involves Technology</h3>
				<p class="paraText">
					In a data-driven world, every field and industry has a digital technology component. Products and services fueling this world are being created at an exponential rate. They are making the world move more efficient and advanced than ever before. With this rate, the increase in employers looking for computer science inclined people increases as well. The bureau of labor statistics predicts that by 2020, 4.6 million of the 9.2 million of S.T.E.M. (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) related jobs will be computing related, however, many of these openings will not be filled (Lockhard and Wolf 90).  The disparity between job openings in computing fields and number of graduates with related degrees pertaining to the field is staggering. From 2017 – 2020, there will be an average of about 150,000 new job openings every year for computing jobs (Employment and Wage Estimates). The shock of this statistic does not only come, instead it is from the number of openings not being taken advantages of alone, but it is also due to the salary given to people in this notoriously lucrative industry. BLS reported in 2012 that the national average salary for computational occupations was $80,020 a year (Lockhard and Wolf 90). The question of why these opportunities are not being seized stems from a lack of exposure throughout the educations system that does not give students exposure and it lacks being a place to facilitate an eager student who has interest in the field.

				<h3 class="paraTitle">Educations Needs to Adapt</h3>
				<p class="paraText">
					The education system has not adapted to the new presence of computer science. At many high schools across the United States the course is either not counted as a credit to graduate or is not offered at all. This alone creates a connotation that it has little value, which is false. Statistics derived from the data of the number of people who took each Advanced Placement test shows that the computer science was taken the second least, further showing how few people take the class (“Summary Report”). A barrier that prevents classes from being added is the difficulty of obtaining a computer science teaching certificate.  With a combination of difficulty of obtaining a certification and getting a low paycheck makes it easy to see where the lack of computer science educators come from. It would be more prosperous for them to get an industry job. There is also a gap between the number of minorities who get access compared to whites. ATG Research found that Blacks and Hispanics are 1.5 and 1.7 times respectively, more interested in taking computer science classes, even though 30% and 16% of them respectively, use computers every day compared to the 42% of white students that do, but are still not given a chance to cultivate their interests into hard skills (Kaczmarczyk and Dopplick 21). The problem is not with the interests of the students, it is with the structure the education system has and the policies and social barriers that block support.

				<h3 class="paraTitle">We Need More Workers</h3>
				<p class="paraText">
					Even founders of the top companies we know today, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Twitter, have joined a public outcry to call upon students to pursue a job in computer science in a movement started by an organization called Code.org. The movement is called What Most Schools Don’t Teach, which is the best diction I can think of to articulate the problem (Code.org, 2013). These multi-billion-dollar people are seen in a viral YouTube video titled What Most Schools Don’t Teach telling the world the importance of computer science, their personal stories, and how it has changed the world for the better (Code.org, 2013). Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter, all talk about how their introduction to programming was not as spectacular as one might think. All of them had a humble beginning either by creating a program at home by themselves or in an introductory programming class. To have such an anti-climactic start, they have solved issues seen as impossible. Today we can easily contact anyone, anywhere in the world by using social media. Advanced machines that can easily run any computational process can be carried around in my pocket due to the introduction of personal computers. I can meet and collaborate with millions of people because of the internet. I predict that pushing more students in the field, will expedite the number of global and domestic issues that can be solved with the powerful tool of programming.

				<h3 class="paraTitle">Skeptic</h3>
				<p class="paraText">
					One might object to computer science becoming prevalent in the education system because of its nature to be too boring and hard to learn. It can require problem-solving skills far more advanced than regular math classes that a large portion of students can barely handle as it is. Computer science has the tendency to be brutally punishing if any mistake is made. One mistake, in one line of code, of one misplaced or forgotten symbol can lead to the entire program to crash. Most concepts are abstract and can seem arbitrary when trying to learn initially. Teaching someone something a concept without having many visual methods of doing so besides showing convoluted graphs, that probably need a class taught by itself to read and understand, is daunting to students. People against computer science’s integration think that schools should just stick to what has been tried and tested for centuries and just leave the advance subject for post-secondary education.

				<h3 class="paraTitle">Hard Working Minds</h3>
				<p class="paraText">
					I disagree and say that schools are not in place to pacify students. They are not here to give students a frictionless path to obtaining an education. They are here to challenge students to expand cognitive abilities and create critical thinking minds to inspire innovation in the world. Giving students easy classes does not fit schools’ purpose. Computer science is an outstanding way to expand how students think. It forces them to think logically with acute problem-solving skills. Yes, students will struggle. Yes, they will become extremely frustrated and experience headaches while learning the material, but it is to their benefit, not detriment.
				</p>

				<h3 class="paraTitle">Conclusion</h3>
				<p class="paraText">
					Computer science education should be implemented more into the education system because it is becoming a necessity to obtain a job and has expanded opportunities within itself. It is also inaccessible to many people due to barriers that need to be resolved. For computing to be such an important aspect of today, we need to provide students with the education to contribute toward the field, prosper in the modern world, and to innovate to make the modern world, archaic.
